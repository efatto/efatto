  In order to test the hr_holiday module in OpenERP, I will  Allocate leaves for Employee and manage leaves and leaves requests.
-
  I assign the dates in the holiday request.
-
  !record {model: hr.time_leave, id: hr_holiday1}:
    name: Sick Leave
    holiday_status_id: holiday_status_cl
    date_from: !eval time.strftime('%Y-%m-10 10:00:00')
    date_to: !eval time.strftime('%Y-%m-11 19:00:00')
    employee_id: hr.employee_fp
    type: remove
-
  I find a small mistake on my leave request to I click on "Refuse" button to correct a mistake.
-
  !workflow {model: hr.time_leave, action: refuse, ref: hr_time_leave_employee1_cl}
-
  I again set to draft and then confirm.
-
  !python {model: hr.time_leave}: |
     self.time_leave_reset(cr, uid, [ref('hr_time_leave_employee1_cl')])
     self.signal_workflow(cr, uid, [ref('hr_time_leave_employee1_cl')], 'confirm')
-
  I validate the holiday request by clicking on "To Approve" button.
-
  !workflow {model: hr.time_leave, action: validate,  ref: hr_time_leave_employee1_cl}
-
  I can also see Summary of Employee's holiday by using "Employee's time_leave" Report. This report will allows to choose to print time_leave with state Confirmed, Validated or both.
